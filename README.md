## Aim

Design and validate a fast, user-friendly mobile flow for **booking a doctor appointment** in a hospital app. The experiment focuses on rapid ideation, user-centred requirements (user stories & persona), a realistic scenario, a clear task flow, and a site information architecture. 

## Algorithm (process / method used)

1. **Solution ideation (Crazy 8s)** — generate 8 distinct low-fidelity ideas in 8 minutes (one-tap slot selection, doctor filters, AI symptom→doctor, quick-rebook, emergency fast-track, calendar heatmap, voice booking, insurance auto-verify).
2. **Define persona & user stories** — create a representative persona (Aadhya, 27) and at least five user stories capturing goals and pain points (quick booking, rebook, filter by specialization, view available slots, reminders).
3. **Create scenario** — pick a user story and write a realistic scenario narrative (Aadhya booking while commuting due to sudden discomfort).
4. **Task flow design** — map the booking steps from app open → choose specialization → pick doctor & slot → confirm → (optional) payment → confirmation.
5. **Information architecture via card sorting** — run open card-sort to group content, produce final site map for a university site used in the exercise (Home → About, Academics, Admissions, Campus Life, Support).
6. **Document outputs & validate** — combine sketches, flows, IA and results into the deliverable.

## Result (conclusion / takeaway)

The combined UX scenario exercise successfully produced a set of practical, testable artefacts: rapid ideation options that prioritize speed and convenience, clear user stories grounded in a realistic persona, a scenario that reveals emotional context, a concise booking task flow suitable for low-fidelity prototyping, and an IA that structures content logically. These artefacts can be used immediately to create wireframes, run usability tests, and iterate the hospital booking experience.
